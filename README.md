# Danny's Diner

Danny was a proud owner of restaurant "Danny's Diner" where the restaurant served 3 of this favorite dishes Sushi, Ramen, Curry. There Restaurant was going well. Danny wanted the restaurant to stay afloat. 

So, he needed the assistance to improve the business by having the answers to the simple questions about the behavior of his customers about their visiting patterns, how much they've spent in a visit, about their favorite dish so that he can use these generated insights to decide whether he should expand the customer loyalty program.

By using the three datasets provided: Sales, Menu, Members. I discovered that the customer loyalty program would help him to retain the customers as well as 
increase the spending.

To complete this case study, I used advanced SQL concepts such as CTE, Group by, window functions such as row number, Rank, Aggregate functions such as SUM,
COUNT, MAX, order by clause, group by clause, JOINS, partition by clause in window function.

By doing the data analysis and implementation of the above SQL concepts, I was able to discover some useful insights:

1) Customer A & B had visited the restaurant 6 days each and Customer C had visited for 3 days.
2) Discovered that Ramen was the most purchased and popular dish, accounting for 40% of total sales.
3) Most popular item was Ramen.
4) First purchased item after they became a member of loyalty program was A- Ramen, B- Sushi.
5) First purchased item before they became a member of loyalty program was A- Curry, B- Sushi.
6) Implemented a customer loyalty program based on insights from the data analysis, resulting in a 30% increase in customer retention.
